# SQLiteTutorial5

A made this .NET MAUI app demonstrating local data persistence using **SQLite**. The app is a simple library that allows users 
to upload and save their favourite books. 

## Overview
This project is part of a learning series focused on building .NET MAUI apps that use SQLite for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Each exercise explores a new feature or concept:
- **SQLiteTutorial1** – Basic notes app  
- **SQLiteTutorial2** – Task manager  
- **SQLiteTutorial3** – Contact list  
- **SQLiteTutorial4** – Image gallery with MediaPicker  
- **SQLiteTutorial5** – *(This project)* A fresh example exploring new SQLite concepts

## Features
- Uses **SQLite-net-pcl** for lightweight local database access  
- Demonstrates async CRUD methods  
- Clean architecture using `Services`, `Models`, and `Views` folders  
- Fully cross-platform: Android, iOS, Windows  

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 or later  
- .NET MAUI workload installed  
- NuGet package: `sqlite-net-pcl`  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.  
3. Restore NuGet packages.  
4. Build and run on your preferred platform (Android emulator, physical device, or Windows).

## 💾 Database Location
The SQLite database file is automatically created in the app’s **LocalApplicationData** folder.


## MY Learning Goals
- Understand SQLite database initialization in MAUI  
- Implement async CRUD operations  
- Use data binding to display and update local data  
- Explore optional extras like image storage, filters, or search
